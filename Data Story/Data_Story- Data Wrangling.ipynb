    "\n",
    "**This analysis assumes as hypothetical scenario **: the government of the City and County of San Francisco bay area  wants to launch a bike safety campaign with a promostional slogan-\"Safer Biking Together”. The objective of the campaign is to raise awareness among the bikers to abide by the safety aspects of the roads to avoid potential accidents. As a part of the campaign electronic boards and posters will be placed across the city. In order to successfully run the campaign, a right strategy needs to be set to run a targeted campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will explore various aspects of the bike sharing data and give recommendation that will be the basis for the campaign. Through this analysis quesitons like the following will be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Who are the bikers- a general overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the peak hour of the day ?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What are the busiest stations to place the advertisements so that maximum people can eb reached ?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What is the dominant age group and gender of the bikers to customize the advertisements accordingly? \n",
    "\n",
    "5) How far they bike ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part of the analysis more strtuctured queries and recommendations will follow."

    "The data consisted of travelling information of  1.65 million passengers from Nov,2017-Sep,2018. From the starting time, diffrent ascpects of time like- hour, duration, whether the day is weekend or not has been extracted. Also from the longitude and latitude, the distance of the journey has been calculated. At this point There are 26 features in the dataset out of which 8 are string values as can be seen from the summary information. \n",

    "I'm most interested in figuring out how the bike riders make their journeys in diffrent parts of the day and whether it also depends on being subscriber or not. Also, I will investigate diffrent age group of the users and their riding patterns in terms of distance and duration covered during the journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the convenience of analysis I will also divide the age, distance and duration data into diffrernt categories related to gender, age group and user type. Finally, I will find the busiest routes for the bikes and based on the analysis I will make recommendations that will be used during the campaign."
