# Data Analyst Nanodegree: Projects Overview

## 1. Project-1: [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/jahid-razan/Data-Analyst_Nano_degree_projects/tree/master/Explore_Weather_Trend)

In this project-

* SQL query is used to download data from a database. Data is then exported to CSV and then the CSV data is then analyzed using Excel.  
* Line chart is created to plot the moving average and city’s temperatures (Amsterdam in my case) is compared with the global temperatures. 
* Observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends are made.


## 2. Project-2: [Analyze a dataset using descriptive statistics](https://github.com/jahid-razan/Data-Analyst_Nano_degree_projects/tree/master/tmdb_movie_analysis)


For this project, data analysis is conducted on a dataset. Following steps outlines the activities of this project: 


* Step One - Choose Your Data Set: Choose the dataset out of the given dataset in the course resource

* Step Two - Get Organized: The starting points is to look at the dataset and brainstorming some questions that could be answered using it. 

* Step Three - Analyze Your Data: Brainstorm some questions to answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. 

* Step Four - Share Your Findings: Having finished analyzing the data, a report is created that shares the most interesting findings using a Jupyter notebook


## 3. Project-3: [Analyze A/B Test Result](https://github.com/jahid-razan/Data-Analyst_Nano_degree_projects/tree/master/Analyze_AB_Test)

* The objective of this project, is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

* The goal is to work through a python notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## 4. Project-4: [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/jahid-razan/Data-Analyst_Nano_degree_projects/tree/master/Data%20Wrangling)

The objective of this project is to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. As a requirement of the projects wrangling efforts have been recorded in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).Tasks in this project are as follows: 

    
* Gathering data from downloadable file `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` provided in the course resource 
* Using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. 
* Assessing data
* Cleaning data
* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
* Reporting on:  A) data wrangling efforts and B) data analyses and visualizations


## 5. Project-5: [Communicate Data Findings & tell a story using data](https://github.com/jahid-razan/Data-Analyst_Nano_degree_projects/tree/master/Telling%20Stories%20with%20Data)

This project is divided into two major parts-

* In the first part, an exploratory data analysis on a dataset is made on a dataset using Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. 

* In the second part of, findings from your exploration is utilized to make recommendations through an explanatory analysis. To this end, a slide deck is created that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate the results.
